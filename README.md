# electurefy

This is the source code for the electurefy app. Make sure you have node installed, which should also have npm installed. 

## Run 'sudo npm install --save' after cloning the repo, and this should create a folder called 'node_modules', which you don't have to touch and it's set to be ignored by github when pushing changes since it's meant to be local. 

## You can run the app by inputing 'node index.js' and it can be found at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
